# Einstaklingsverkefni 5

Developer: Sandesh Kunwar

This project utilizes Prismic as a headless CMS for content management. The site is hosted on [Vercel](https://hippies-central-vert.vercel.app/). 

For styling, a combination of Tailwind CSS, SCSS/Sass, and Tailwind Typography was employed.


It leverages TypeScript for enhanced type safety and maintainability.

Key Features:

    Headless CMS with Prismic: Manages content efficiently through a user-friendly interface.
    Next.js Framework: Offers server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for optimized performance and SEO.
    TypeScript: Improves code quality and reduces runtime errors with static type checking.
    Tailwind CSS: Provides a utility-first approach for rapid and responsive UI development.
    SCSS/Sass: Extends CSS with variables, mixins, and nesting for better maintainability.
    Tailwind Typography: Integrates seamlessly with Tailwind CSS to simplify consistent typography.
    Reusable Page Types: Promotes content management efficiency by allowing the creation of multiple pages with similar layouts and functionality.

Project Setup:

    Clone the repository.
    Install dependencies: npm install
    Create a Prismic repository and configure environment variables.
    Start the development server: npm run dev

Technologies:
Frontend:

    Next.js ([https://nextjs.org/])
    React ([https://legacy.reactjs.org/](https://react.dev/])
    TypeScript ([https://www.typescriptlang.org/])
    Tailwind CSS ([https://tailwindcss.com/])
    SCSS/Sass ([https://sass-lang.com/])
    Tailwind Typography ([https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography])


Reusable Page Types:

    HomePage: The first reusable page type is ready, providing a foundation for the website's main content.
    Case Study: The second reusable page type is also functional, allowing the creation of multiple case studies with a consistent structure. This reusability simplifies content management, as demonstrated by using the same case study page for Patagonia and Urban Oasis.

There are also lots of slices which can be reused , such as bento , showcase , and so on.


Further Development:

This starter template provides a solid foundation. You can further customize it by:

    Creating additional reusable page types.
    Implementing custom components and functionalities.
    Integrating with third-party libraries and services.
