Prismic is used as headless CMS.


Site is hosted on [Vercel]([https://hippies-central-vert.vercel.app/]. 




for styling : Tailwind CSS , along with Scss/Sass, Tailwind Typography , was used . 

HomePage (1st resusable page type) is ready and also Case Study(2nd resusable page type) is ready . So, Content Management team can easily make multiple pages of this type as they are resuable page type. for e.g we used the same case study reusable page for patagonia case study and urban oasis's case study.
