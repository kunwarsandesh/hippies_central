This project utilizes Prismic as a headless CMS for content management. The site is hosted on [Vercel](https://hippies-central-vert.vercel.app/). 

For styling, a combination of Tailwind CSS, SCSS/Sass, and Tailwind Typography was employed.

Reusable Page Types:

    HomePage: The first reusable page type is ready, providing a foundation for the website's main content.
    Case Study: The second reusable page type is also functional, allowing the creation of multiple case studies with a consistent structure. This reusability simplifies content management, as demonstrated by using the same case study page for Patagonia and Urban Oasis.
